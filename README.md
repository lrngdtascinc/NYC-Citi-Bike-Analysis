## Summary 

When looking at the peak hours and the amount of popular Citi-Bike locations we can see that there is a significant amount of bike usage around the times people go to and come from work, which leads me to believe it would be a profitable idea because we would be providing a solution to common problems, mainly being daily commuting to work, and carbon emissions by providing a reliable and carbon neutral way to get to work in the morning and home from work in the evening. I've inclused two additional visualizations below for future analysis. The two charts portray the most popular start stations and end stations, so that with a future analysis, one would find whether there is a connections between the stations success and its location, and distance from other stations.
